Database manager for the electronic inventory.

This is a project made for the high-school students from the college Colegio de Estudios Científicos y Tecnológicos del Estado de Queretaro (CECyTEQ).
In this project, I made a DB control system for the existent electronic inventory in the Electronic career.
This project is made with Visual Basic .NET framework and with SQL managed by MySQL DBMS. It's based on the CRUD principles.
This is considerated as my second project, representing a good progress from the first project.
